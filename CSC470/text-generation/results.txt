1. Having run `lstm_large.py` and then used the last epoch 50 with loss of 0.1163, 
I achieved the following result with `lstm_large_generate_text.py`

```bash
$ python3 lstm_large_generate_text.py cat-in-the-hat/weights-improvement-50-0.1163-bigger.hdf5

" t went on there that day?

should we tell her about it?
now, what should we do?
well...
what would y "
ou do
if your mother asked you?
they will gome!'
said the cat in the hat.
'i always pick up all my playthings
and so...
i will show you another good game that i know!'

and then he ran out.
and, then, fast as a fox,
the cat in the hat
came back in with a box.
a big red wood box.
it was shut with a hook.
'now look at this trick,'
said the cat in the hat.
'i always pick up all my playthings
and so...
i will show you another good game that i know!'

and then he ran out.

2. Decreasing the size of the sliding window `seq_length` with a value of 25 instead of a 100

The algorithm spent less time training because there is less information used to make predictions,
therefore lowering the complexity.

However, the smaller sliding window resulted in a poor performance predicting words.

$ python3 lstm_large_generate_text.py sliding-window-25/Cat_in_the_Hat.txt sliding-window-25/weights-improvement-49-0.1291-bigger.hdf5
